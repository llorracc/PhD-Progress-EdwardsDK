# Putting JMP in Shape for Submission

Your paper on rate of return heterogeneity and the distribution of wealth has most of the substance it will need to be in shape for submission to a journal.

This is a plan for getting it to a submittable state this spring. I would propose a submission date of April 15 so that there's a reasonable chance you might get a reply by June.  Elsewhere I will make a plan for the non-JMP-related activities I'd propose to have you work on.

Here is a sketch of the specific steps you will need to take.

## Thorough Update vs the Literature

The referees for your paper are likely to be other people who have worked on this topic or similar topics. So you need to make _sure_ you have found and appropriately referenced all of the papers that are directly related to yours.

Your starting point should be to consult faculty members _other than me_ about the substance of the paper and get their views about what you need to change to make the paper acceptable to a wide audience. Stelios, for example, has strong views about the extent to which you need to have a complete, well-specified macroeconomic accounting system where there is a balance between total aggregate income and consumption. Greg may have views on the finance side of things; and so on. 

I do not anticipate that you will need to make major changes in the substance of your model in response to this feedback. The upshot of these conversations will be that you will need to modify your description of the model so that it connects with these perspectives.

- [ ] Write a brief (1-2 pages) plan for how to address these points

Having done that, you'll be ready for the actual lit review.

- [ ] Make a LitMaps map of the papers you are already citing in your paper
- [ ] Put those papers in a PaperPile folder that you share with me

When you've done this, you should do a deeper dive:
- [ ] Google something like "Best AI tools for scientific literature search"
- [ ] Find one that will let you upload a bibliography
- [ ] Chat with the AI to identify ones you should read 
- [ ] Read them
- [ ] Update the "literature review section of your paper"
- [ ] Add references throughout the text to papers you've found

This should be done by mid-Feb

## Make Sure Your Results are Replicable

The "REMARK" architecture gives a template for this; so 
- [ ] Put your paper and its supporting materials in a standalone repo
- [ ] Follow the instructions to make that repo into a REMARK

This should be done by end-Feb

## Add Robustness Checking
- [ ] Make a plan to explore how your results depend on parameter values
    - [ ] implement with bash shell script `reproduce_robustness.sh` 
- [ ] While you are doing this, use an AI to improve your code
    - [ ] My current preference is Claude Sonnet 3.5
    - [ ] Improvements include adding comments to explain what you are doing

## Rewrite the Text and Your Slides

You will need to do a thorough rewrite of the text to take into account the things you have learned in doing all of the above. You should identify a good AI tool to help with that process. Google something like "Good AI tool for proofreading academic papers"

- [ ] You need to systematically get feedback on all parts of the paper
- [ ] The AI might also have suggestions for improvements of figures, etc

You should be working on the paper and the slides simultaneously. Often, you may realize things while working on the slides that suggest revisions to the text (or vice versa).

This will probably take most of March

## Present the Revised Paper and Slides

You can give a brownbag talk in the informal macro brownbag lunch. See if there is a slot for you to speak to the regular macro seminar audience as well.

The ideal timing of this would be late March or early April.

## Make Any Final Revisions

You will get some feedback during your presentation. Incorporate that feedback into the paper and polish it.

## Decide Where to Submit

Often a good way to decide this is to look at the places that the papers you cite most have been published. Because this paper does not have any fundamentally new technologies or breathtaking surprises, you should not aim for a top-5 journal, and maybe not a top field journal (like AEJ-Macro or something). 

## Submit

I hope that by mid-April you will have done all of this and be ready to submit.

Since you have not submitted a paper before, I asked ChatGPT to make a generic checklist of the steps you will want to take in preparing the paper for submission; those are below. (some of this is repetitive with material above)

## Content Refinement
- [ ] **Clarity and Argumentation**:
  - [ ] Ensure your argument is logical and flows well.
      - [ ] Learn how to get AI feedback on this
  - [ ] Avoid jargon unless it's necessary for your field.
- [ ] **Abstract**:
  - [ ] Write a concise and compelling abstract summarizing your research question, methods, results, and significance.
- [ ] **Introduction**:
  - [ ] Clearly state the problem, research gap, objectives, and contribution.
- [ ] **Methods**:
  - [ ] Ensure methodological details are thorough enough for replication.
- [ ] **Results and Discussion**:
  - [ ] Present results clearly with appropriate tables, figures, and statistical analyses.
  - [ ] Interpret results in the discussion without overstating their significance.
- [ ] **Conclusion**:
  - [ ] Summarize findings, implications, and future directions.

## Formatting and Style
- [ ] **Structure**:
  - [ ] Follow the journal’s section headings and formatting style.
- [ ] **Citations and References**:
  - [ ] Ensure all in-text citations have corresponding entries in the bibliography and follow the correct style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago).
- [ ] **Figures and Tables**:
  - [ ] Ensure clarity, proper labeling, and compliance with journal specifications (e.g., file resolution, color requirements).
- [ ] **Language and Grammar**:
  - [ ] Proofread for grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.
  - [ ] Use tools like Grammarly or ask a colleague for feedback.

## Technical and Supplementary Material
- [ ] **Figures, Tables, and Graphs**:
  - [ ] Ensure high-quality images (e.g., 300 DPI for figures).
- [ ] **Data and Code**:
  - [ ] Prepare supplementary files, datasets, or code for reproducibility if required by the journal.
- [ ] **Conflict of Interest and Ethics Statements**:
  - [ ] Include required declarations and IRB approval information, if applicable.

## Final Proofreading
- [ ] **Read Aloud**:
  - [ ] Spot awkward phrasing and typos.
- [ ] **Seek Feedback**:
  - [ ] Ask colleagues or collaborators for a fresh perspective.
- [ ] **Use Professional Editing Services (if needed)**:
  - [ ] For non-native English speakers or to ensure the manuscript is polished.

## Submission Preparation
- [ ] **Cover Letter**:
  - [ ] Write a concise cover letter summarizing your research, its significance, and why it fits the journal.
- [ ] **File Organization**:
  - [ ] Ensure all files (manuscript, figures, tables, supplementary materials) are properly named and in the correct format.
- [ ] **Online Submission**:
  - [ ] Create an account on the journal’s submission portal and follow the submission steps.
  - [ ] Double-check for completeness before submitting.

## Post-Submission
- [ ] **Track Submission**:
  - [ ] Monitor the journal’s online system for updates.
- [ ] **Prepare for Revisions**:
  - [ ] If accepted with revisions, be ready to respond promptly to further reviewer or editor feedback.
