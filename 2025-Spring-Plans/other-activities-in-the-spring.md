# Other Activities in the Spring

The revision of your JMP will take most of your time at least through the middle of April.

Once that is done I have several ideas for what you might do with the rest of the semester:

## Modify Your Model to explore other kinds of heterogeneity

The time preference rate and the rate of return are not the only kinds of heterogeneity that should affect saving. Relative risk aversion, the degree of income risk, and expected income growth are also determinants. My BufferStockTheory paper derives the _impatience conditions_ that determine whether agents want to build up or run down their assets. The broadest way of posing the question would be something like: _Is the degree of [growth impatience] a sufficient statistic (or nearly sufficient) for the target level of wealth?_ For example, you might get an impatience rate of 0.03 either from having a low time preference factor or a low interest rate or a low degree of relative risk aversion or from various combinations of these. Given that the degree of impatience is 0.03, does it matter how that impatience rate comes about?

## Continue Your Work on Trust and the Rate of Return

My sense is that you feel you've hit a wall in trying to replicate the Pistaferri et al paper. You and I can review that and see if we can find a way forward.

But replicating the Pistaferri et al paper is neither necessary nor sufficient for exploring the relationship between trust and choices. I know you've read most of the literature you've been able to find in economics on that subject, but I know there is other literature, in psychology and maybe sociology and perhaps other fields, that is relevant for this question. Reading that material may give you new ideas for how to pursue these ideas

## Get A Deeper Understanding of the Code and Theory

You now have a solid understanding of the standard tools for solving the kinds of models you are using in your JMP. But there are important new developments in our ability to solve these kinds of models. Deep learning, AI, etc have enormous potential to make it possible to solve our models much more efficiently. You might, for example, do a deep dive into the REMARK of the paper of Maliar, Maliar, and Winant that uses deep learning methods to solve the Krusell-Smith model, and then see if you can apply what you have learned to improve your methods for solving your own models.
